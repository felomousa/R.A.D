## Features ðŸŽ®

- **Real-Time Health Tracking**: Keeps an eye on your health bar so you don't have to.
- **LED Matrix Display**: Lights up your room with your current health status.
- **DIY Satisfaction**: Mix coding and electronics to create something truly unique.
- **Personal Touch**: Customize how you want your health displayed.

## How It Works ðŸ› 

### The Easy Explanation

1. **In Minecraft**: The mod watches your health.
2. **Sending Data**: Whenever your health changes, the mod tells the Raspberry Pi about it.
3. **Display Time**: The Raspberry Pi then updates an LED matrix to show your health in real-time.

### A Bit More Technical

1. **Minecraft Mod**: Utilizes game events to monitor real-time health changes. It captures health data and sends it over to a Flask web server running on the Raspberry Pi through HTTP POST requests, formatted in JSON.
2. **Data Handling on Raspberry Pi**: The Flask server listens for incoming data, parses the JSON payload to extract health information, and processes it to control the LED matrix. The `rgbmatrix` library is used alongside Python imaging libraries to create and update heart icons on the display.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

### What You Need

- Minecraft with Fabric installed
- Raspberry Pi (any model that's handy)
- RGB LED matrix compatible with Raspberry Pi
- Basic knowledge of your Raspberry Pi's terminal

### Installation Guide

1. **Install the RAD Mod**:
   - Drop the RAD mod file into your Minecraft `mods` folder.

2. **Set Up Your Raspberry Pi**:
   - Ensure Python and Flask are installed.
   - Connect your LED matrix to the Raspberry Pi.

3. **Run the RAD.py Script**:
   - Copy `RAD.py` to your Raspberry Pi.
   - Run `python RAD.py` in your terminal to start the Flask server.

4. **Play Minecraft and Watch**:
   - As you play, watch your health status update live on the LED matrix!




Enjoy RAD, and may your health bar always be full! ðŸ’–
